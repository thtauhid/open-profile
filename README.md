# Open Profile

Unified profile to showcase your work.

## How it works

The app will fetch your data from different sources and display them in a single page.

Currently we fetch data from:

- GitHub
- Data from a JSON file created by the user

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thtauhid/open-profile
cd open-profile
npm install
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build
```

## Development

Currently, we are following this [wireframe](Wireframe.pdf) for the UI.
