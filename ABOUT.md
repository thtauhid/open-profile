# Open Profile

We dream of a time when recruiters will not ask for a resume. Instead, they will ask for your Open Profile ID. Open Profile will become the standard for sharing your professional profile. It will be the first thing you share with a recruiter, a potential employer, a potential client, a potential partner, a potential investor, a potential co-founder, a potential employee, a potential collaborator, a potential customer, a potential anything.
